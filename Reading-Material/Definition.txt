molecular imaging techniques: X-ray crystallography and single particle cryo electron microscopy 

visual proteomics: the molecular mapping of whole cells

Cryo electron tomography (cryo ET): 
It is a three-dimensional imaging technique that is suitable for imaging biological structures with a resolution in the order of nanometres

Used for:  Visualization of the three-dimensional shape of single and unique structures like
macromolecular complexes, pleomorphic viruses, small bacteria and slices or thin areas of cell
